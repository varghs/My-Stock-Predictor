<h1 align="center">My Stock Predictor</h1>

This is a neural network that aims to predict statistics such as open, high, low and close prices for specific stocks.  
  
The program reaches out to the [FMP](https://financialmodelingprep.com) API to fetch stock history data for a certain company, then serializes the data and feeds it into a neural network powered by [Brain.js](https://brain.js.org). The network analyzes the data given and generates a forecast for the company's future stock statistics.
